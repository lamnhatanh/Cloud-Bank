I assume that you have already installed javafx.
Before you run the project, please:

-Install MySQL connector for java (Connector/J 5.1.49) by using this link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html
Download the Platform Independent, ZIP Archive with 3.5M
After that, add the connector to library of my project.

-Download XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL

-Open browser and go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
After that, create a new database names: bankusers.
Then import: users.sql that I attach in my project to the bankusers.

You got everything now and ready to test the project.
